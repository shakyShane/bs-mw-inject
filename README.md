BrowserSync MiddleWare CSS Injection Test
===

This demo was created with the intent to allow BrowserSync
to be able to inject CSS changes when the response returned
has a content-type of `text/css`, instead of reloading
the browser.

### Installation/Usage:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Perform changes to `main.less` and `deferred.less` files
